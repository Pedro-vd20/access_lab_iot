this file should define 2 things
sensors: list with ALL the sensors of all types
            Any beseecher sensor connected to the station must be appended to
            this list
gps: unlike the sensors, the gps will be a unique variable with the gps
beseecher.

When initializing sensors, ALWAYS use a try-except block in case the RPi
fails to start the sensors at boot. The error beseecher class will store any
error information that comes up and will allow data-collection to report on
the error.

set up indeces for all sensors

DO NOT MODIFY THIS PART, ONLY MODIFY SENSOR DECLARATIONS ABOVE

these index set up is necessary for multithreading
we don't know which thread will finish first, these indeces will make sure
    the order of sensors is kept (we want the data collected by sensor i to
    always be the ith index in the data file)
'''
indeces = {}
for sensor in sensors:
    indeces[sensor.SENSOR] = indeces.get(sensor.SENSOR, -1) + 1
    sensor.index = indeces[sensor.SENSOR]
